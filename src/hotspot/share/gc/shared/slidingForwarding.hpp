/**
 * SlidingForwarding is a method to store forwarding information in a compressed form into the object header,
 * that has been specifically designed for sliding compaction GCs.
 * It avoids overriding the compressed class pointer in the upper bits of the header, which would otherwise
 * be lost. SlidingForwarding requires only small side tables and guarantees constant-time access and modification.
 *
 * The idea is to use a pointer compression scheme very similar to the one that is used for compressed oops.
 * We divide the heap into number of logical regions. Each region spans maximum of 2^NUM_BITS words.
 * We take advantage of the fact that sliding compaction can forward objects from one region to a maximum of
 * two regions (including itself, but that does not really matter). We need 1 bit to indicate which region is forwarded
 * into. We also currently require the two lowest header bits to indicate that the object is forwarded.
 *
 * For addressing, we need a table with N*2 entries, for N logical regions. For each region, it gives the base
 * address of the two target regions, or a special placeholder if not used.
 *
 * Adding a forwarding then works as follows:
 * Given an original address 'orig', and a 'target' address:
 * - Look-up first target base of region of orig. If not yet used,
 *   establish it to be the base of region of target address. Use that base in step 3.
 * - Else, if first target base is already used, check second target base. This must either be unused, or the
 *   base of the region of our target address. If unused, establish it to be the base of the region of our target
 *   address. Use that base for next step.
 * - Now we found a base address. Encode the target address with that base into lowest NUM_BITS bits, and shift
 *   that up by 3 bits. Set the 3rd bit if we used the secondary target base, otherwise leave it at 0. Set the
 *   lowest two bits to indicate that the object has been forwarded. Store that in the lowest NUM_BITS+3 bits of the
 *   original object's header.
 *
 * Similarily, looking up the target address, given an original object address works as follows:
 * - Load lowest NUM_BITS + 3 from original object header. Extract target region bit and compressed address bits.
 * - Depending on target region bit, load base address from the target base table by looking up the corresponding entry
 *   for the region of the original object.
 * - Decode the target address by using the target base address and the compressed address bits.
